# verse
Verse is a command line tool that allows you to easily figure out where in the convoluted mess of files and subdirectories on your computer you have created version control repositories (Git, Mercurial, and CVS are supported). Simply run the tool from a root directory to get a neatly-formatted printout of all the repositories you have created in the root or any of its subdirectories.

So far, I have only implemented a repository search function, but I am working on ways to automate some common commands like pushing and pulling. Stay tuned for coming attractions!!!
